5. **Feature Prioritization**
   - What are the must-have features?
   - What are the nice-to-have features?
   - What features can be deferred to later phases?
   - What is the minimum viable product (MVP)?

## Technical Context

6. **System Integration**
   - What existing systems must we integrate with?
   - What are the integration points?
   - What are the integration constraints?
   - Are there existing APIs we must use?

7. **Performance Requirements**
   - What is the expected user load?
   - What are the peak usage scenarios?

   - What are the throughput requirements?

8. **Security and Compliance**
   - What security requirements exist?
   - What compliance standards must be met?
   - What data protection requirements exist?
   - What authentication/authorization is needed?

9. **Technology Stack**
   - What technologies are already in use?
   - Are there technology preferences or constraints?
   - Are there technologies we must avoid?
   - What is the team's expertise?

10. **Deployment Constraints**
    - Where will this be hosted?
    - Are there hosting preferences or constraints?
    - What are the deployment requirements?
    - Are there geographic restrictions?

## User Context

11. **User Workflows**
    - What are the primary user tasks?
    - What is the typical user journey?
    - What are the common user paths?
    - What are the edge cases?

12. **Platform Support**
    - What devices must be supported?
    - What browsers must be supported?
    - Are there platform-specific requirements?
    - What is the mobile strategy?

13. **Accessibility**
    - What accessibility standards must be met?
    - Are there specific accessibility requirements?
    - Who are the users with accessibility needs?
    - What assistive technologies must be supported?

14. **User Technical Proficiency**
    - What is the user's technical skill level?
    - How complex can the interface be?
    - What training or onboarding is needed?
    - What is the learning curve tolerance?

## Risk Assessment

15. **Technical Risks**
    - What are the potential technical challenges?
    - What are the unknown or unproven technologies?
    - What are the integration risks?
    - What are the scalability concerns?

16. **External Dependencies**
    - What external parties are involved?
    - What are the dependencies on third-party services?
    - What are the coordination requirements?
    - What happens if external dependencies fail?

17. **Contingency Planning**
    - What are the fallback options?
    - What are the alternative approaches?
    - What can be simplified if needed?
    - What are the must-have vs. can-cut features?

## Market Research Questions

18. **Competitive Analysis**
    - Who are the direct competitors?
    - Who are the indirect competitors?
    - What do competitors do well?
    - What gaps exist in the market?

19. **User Research**
    - What user feedback exists from similar products?
    - What are the common user complaints?
    - What features do users request most?
    - What are the unmet user needs?

20. **Cost Research**
    - What do similar solutions cost to build?
    - What are the infrastructure cost estimates?
    - What are the third-party service costs?
    - What is the total cost of ownership?

## Documentation Protocol

**For each question:**
- Document the answer clearly
- Note any assumptions
- Flag any ambiguities
- Identify any missing information
- Obtain confirmation on critical decisions

**Before proceeding to design:**
- All questions should have answers (even if "TBD" with timeline)
- Critical decisions should have explicit confirmation
- Ambiguities should be flagged and resolved
- Missing information should be identified with a plan to obtain it
